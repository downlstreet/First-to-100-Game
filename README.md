# First-to-100-Game

First to 100 is a game of luck between you and the computer. Roll the dice to see if you can score higher than the computer! Each roll gets you closer and closer. Cross your fingers for pairs and triplets!

### Motivation

Being a fan of all things game boards, rolling dice, and pure chance, I mulled over what game would be fun to emulate. Having already worked on a game with cards, I decided a game of dice would be a good starting off project. Also being a lover of numbers, I figured why not make this a little more challenging with multiple rules of points measuring. Guided by the game Farkle, I created First to 500.
